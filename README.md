# Installation

Setup a virtual environment first with
```
python -m venv venv
```

Install all requirements from the `requirements.txt` file first by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will in turn install `sympy`, which is **for now** not necessary, so just ignore it. The installation instructions, should they be necessary, can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/sympy/), under the installation subsection.
